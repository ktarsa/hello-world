# hello-world
Kat enters the brave world of coding! I am excited.

After years of being told I should learn some coding, and many months of my friend taking me to meetups where I understand little, it is time to see what can be done. Tutorial first, and then hopefully little projects.

I am also here to learn more about programmers and find talented coders looking for new opportunities! I work for HireNetworks, a Raleigh-based staffing and recruiting agency that houses eight-ten tenured recruiters who pride themselves on making the best hire first and finding opportunities for talented candidates that will help them be more appreciated, excited to go into work, and compensated fairly.

When you're looking for a job, have you ever heard it isn't about what you know, it's about who you know? At HireNetworks, it is about who we know.

Call me at nine-one-nine, nine-eight-one-six-two-zero-zero extension 320 to find out how our networks can help you.
